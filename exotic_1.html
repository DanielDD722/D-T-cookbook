      <h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>First I prepare the tangzhong. Tangzhong is a type of pre-dough used in Japanese milk buns. With this pre-dough, the liquid is better bound in the flour and the rolls are juicier.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the water and flour in a small saucepan with a whisk. No lumps should remain. Then stir in the soy milk.</li>
        <li>Gently heat the Tangzhong while stirring. The dough must not start to boil, it should reach a temperature of 65-70°. You can always take the pot off the flame. The pre-dough is good when it has a pudding-like consistency, which takes a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the stove and let cool.</li>
        <li>Place the flour in a large bowl, mix with the seitan fix, salt and activated charcoal. Then make a deep well in it. The Seitan-Fix gives the flour a higher gluten content, which makes the dough rise better and become more airy. If you don't have a seitan fix right now, you can leave it out if necessary.</li>
        <li>Crumble the yeast into the well and sprinkle 1 tablespoon of sugar over it. Heat the soy milk slightly so that it is lukewarm. However, it must not get warmer than 40°, as this will destroy the yeast cultures. It's at the right temperature when you put a fingertip in and the soy milk feels neither cold nor warm. Pour the soy milk over the yeast-sugar mixture, then stir in gently. Rather little flour should get into the liquid. Now leave the yeast pre-dough to stand for 15 minutes. The yeast should have risen nicely at the end and the soy milk should be full of bubbles.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly knead all the ingredients for the dough and the Tangzhong together. This is best done by hand. At first the dough for the Black Burger Buns is very sticky, after a while it becomes smoother.
          If the batter is too dry, add a little more soy milk. If it is still sticky, knead in some flour. All in all, the colorful dough is easy to knead, smooth, slightly moist, and only slightly sticky dough.
          In order for the dough to rise well, you should knead it for several minutes.
          Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Now knead the dough again by hand.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a roll on a little flour and cut into 8 equal pieces. Shape each piece of dough into a round burger bun. Spread the blanks of the buns on a baking tray lined with baking paper and let rise again in a warm place for 20 minutes. Then brush with the chickpea-soy milk-water mixture. Sprinkle the burger buns with black cumin and/or black sesame.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180° top and bottom heat and bake the black burger buns for about 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Let cool, cover and enjoy. Enjoy your meal!</li>
